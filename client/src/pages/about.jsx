            <p>
                Welcome to our website! This is a simple React application that was built using the create-react-app tool. It is a great way to quickly get started with a new React project.
            </p>
            <p>
                The application features a home page with a map of the UNC Charlotte campus, an about us page with some information about the developers, and a contact page with a simple form for getting in touch.
            </p>
            <p>
                The developers of this application are Brody Ehorn, Conner Hansen, Abel Varghese, Trenity Gilford, and William Harvey. We are all students at UNC Charlotte, and we built this application as a project for our software engineering class.
